  - Redo the subtitles system (can't handle more than one subtitle).
- Retrieving official romanization lyrics from MusixMatch.
- Add YTMusic lyrics provider (waiting for [PR merge](https://github.com/zS1L3NT/ts-npm-ytmusic-api/pull/55)).
- Add Genius lyrics provider.
- More precise lyrics wave animation (timing).
### v2.0
- Add Windows Media Control support.
- Add dynamic background because the original repo promised it.
